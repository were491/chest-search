# chest-search
Chest searching for fabric.

edit: it has come to my attention that [roughly searchable](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-searchable) and/or [roughly enough items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-enough-items) is/are (an)other mod(s) that also allow(s) you to search within chests. so that was my entire sunday for nothing lol
